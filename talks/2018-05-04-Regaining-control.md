summary: >
  A state transition can be modeled as a simple function:</br></br>

  <code>type State[S, A] = S => (S, A)</code></br></br>

  In this talk we’ll see how indexed monads like the State Monad are built
  around this simple concept.</br></br>

  From side-effect free state modification to Finite State Machines. The State
  Monad is immensely useful and actually - as will be shown throughout this
  talk, definitely, not scary at all.</br></br>

  We’ll get comfortable with the state monad from the Cats library, and learn
  how we can write functional APIs that describe state transition on the type
  level using indexed monads.
